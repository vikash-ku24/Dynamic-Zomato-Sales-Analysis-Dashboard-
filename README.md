# Zomato Sales Analysis Dashboard - Power BI

## Project Summary

This Power BI project focuses on creating an insightful and interactive dashboard for Zomato's sales data. The project involved data modeling, data transformation, DAX measures, and visualizations that provide a deep analysis of sales, user demographics, and trends.

### 1. Data Model Development
- Built a robust data model from multiple data sources to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

### 2. Optimizing Power Query
- Optimized Power Query operations to address RAM limitations and improve performance.

### 3. Data Loading
- Cleaned and transformed data was loaded into Power BI for further analysis.

### 4. Data Transformation
- **Headers:** Added headers for better data clarity.
- **Merging Queries:** Used various join types (left outer, right outer, full outer, inner, left anti, right anti) to merge queries.
- **Null Value Replacement:** Replaced null values with meaningful alternatives for data accuracy.

### 5. Measures Table
- Detached measures from specific tables to provide flexibility across the dashboard.

### 6. Slicers for Sales and Quantity
- Added interactive slicers to enable better data exploration for sales and quantities.

### 7. Edit Interactions
- Ensured slicers do not affect total amounts or quantities to maintain accurate visualizations.

### 8. Date Formatting
- Transformed date strings into a consistent `YYYY` format for uniformity across the dashboard.

### 9. Top Cities Bar Chart
- Created a bar chart to visualize top cities by sales amount.

### 10. Cards and Images
- Added cards to display key metrics like ratings and orders, and inserted relevant images.

### 11. DAX Measures
- Developed DAX measures to calculate total orders, number of cities, and customer counts.

### 12. Image Actions
- Enabled navigation between different pages of the dashboard using clickable images.

### 13. Dynamic Labeling
- Used DAX measures for dynamic labeling of bar charts (e.g., "Top 5 Cities by Sales Amount").

### 14. Gradient Effects
- Enhanced bar charts with gradient effects for a more visually appealing representation.

### 15. User Count Column Chart
- Created dynamic user count measures using DAX and visualized them in a column chart.

### 16. Yearly Measures
- Calculated sales and other key metrics for both the current and previous years.

### 17. User Gain and Loss Metrics
- Developed measures to track user gains and losses over time.

### 18. Sales Metrics
- Calculated sales metrics for both the current and previous years to track performance.

### 19. Gender Analysis
- Analyzed user retention and gain by gender using a clustered bar chart.

### 20. Second Page: Customer Retention
- Focused on customer retention by gender and total active customers by age.

### 21. Third Page: Demographic Analysis
- Provided a demographic-wise analysis of sales, ratings, and active users.

### 22. City Table
- Created a table displaying city-wise sales, ratings, and active users for detailed analysis.

### 23. Dropdown Navigation
- Implemented dropdown slicers for city, ratings, and restaurant selection, enhancing user experience.

### 24. Inter-Report Navigation
- Enabled seamless navigation between different dashboards for a smooth user experience.
